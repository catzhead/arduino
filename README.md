# Arduino projects


# moulin-v2


The main project is a tachometer for the wheel of a [watermill in France](https://ondreville-sur-essonne.fr/le-moulin-de-chatillon/).


Note: the project uses an Arduino Mega2560 because it needs more pins than are available
on the standard Arduino.


# tests


Small projects to test several components the tachometer: LCD screen, LED panel,
etc.
